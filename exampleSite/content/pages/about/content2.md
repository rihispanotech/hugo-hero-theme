In the potential of the Hispanic community so we decided to create the Rhode Island Group for Hispanic Technology because a lot of Hispanics come to this country, especially Rhode Island, and sometimes they are not sure where to find the technical resources they would like to learn more about. The language barrier many of them have can difficult things as well. Even though we urge every single Hispanic and business owner who assists in our workshops to keep learning English, we also want them to learn technology and computer science while doing that as it is part of our daily life.
